# 12 Projects of Codemas using TinyGo
This repository is using the 12 Projects of Codemas from Pihut but instead of using
MicroPython it will be using TinyGo to achieve the same results.

The kit used can be found here:
[Maker Advent Calendar](https://thepihut.com/products/maker-advent-calendar-includes-raspberry-pi-pico-h)

## Projects
Each project will be within their own directory to allow for each day to work without other components.

### List of Projects:

- Setting up the Board

## Setting up TinyGo
Setting up TinyGo can be found via their website for the latest version of the language.
[TinyGo Install](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/)

For our example we will be using version `tinygo version 0.26.0 darwin/amd64 (using go version go1.19.3 and LLVM version 14.0.0)`

## Components used for all the projects

- Raspberry Pico H
- USB to Micro USB cable
- Breadboard
